# OneMeal

OneMeal is a platform in which users can report hunger. And other users from same area can provide a meal.

# The Idea

>On a busy day, while you were rushing to office; you discern a homeless man on the road side. You want to help, but you’re in a hurry; so you walk through the man. Even-though you passed that person, the feeling of guilt is still there. 

This is a story of me and you. Sometimes you won’t be able to do things that you want to do. What can we do to eliminate such incidents? We have a solution; were we join together to abolish the hunger! 

A platform were you can report the deprived on the app and the other person, who are capable of affording an extra meal, can locate the needy with the help of google map and succor them. 

There is nothing as rejoiceful as feeding the hungry around us. 

The happiness in reporting, serving and of course receiving. 

Join with us on the journey and to fight to end hunger around you and me. Let’s make this happen with "[OneMeal]".
